# #todo

- create chapter fragments that correspond to each category
- create swipeable layout and flippable flashcards for the flashcards activity
- flashcards should have webview so that latex codes can be rendered through mathjax
- create vector graphics background that stays constant on all window except when running the flashcards
- the background should be invertable for day/night theme (or use different backgrounds if possible)
  - status bar text color and the app background should contrast
- haptic feedbacks for the end of each card stack; stack should shuffle every run
- use of cache/data to avoid parsing flashcards xml every run
  - parse when the app is opened for the first time?
  - user selects certain card stacks to parse?
- add feature to add new flashcards
  - xmls might be a bad idea if i want the app to attach attributes to flashcards like "favorites" and "studied" etc.
