        <question>Fiber Bundles</question>
        <answer><![CDATA[ A fiber bundle \(E\) with base \(B\) and a fiber \(F\) is a family of smooth manifolds,
            all diffeomorphic to \(F\), smoothly parametrized by \(B\).
            A (smooth) fiber bundle \((E,\ B,\ \varphi,\ F)\) is given by:
            1. Smooth manifolds \(E\), \(B\), and \(F\).
            2. \(\varphi\) is a smooth map (called the bundle projection) from \(E\) to \(B\).
            3. For each \(b \in B\), there exists an open set \(U\) containing \(b\) such that \(\varphi^{-1}(U)\) is diffeomorphic to \(U \times F\) via \(\phi\), and \(\pi_1 \circ \phi : \varphi^{-1}(U) \longrightarrow U\) is equal to \(\varphi\).
