        <answer><![CDATA[<strong>Fiber Bundles:</strong><br />
            A fiber bundle \(E\) with base \(B\) and a fiber \(F\) is a family of smooth manifolds,
            all diffeomorphic to \(F\), smoothly parametrized by \(B\).<br /><br />
            A (smooth) fiber bundle \((E, B, \varphi, F)\) is given by:<br />
            1. Smooth manifolds \(E\), \(B\), and \(F\).<br />
            2. \(\varphi\) is a smooth map (called the bundle projection) from \(E\) to \(B\).<br />
            3. For each \(b \in B\), there exists an open set \(U\) containing \(b\) such that \(\varphi^{-1}(U)\) is diffeomorphic to \(U \times F\) via \(\phi\),
            and \(\pi_1 \circ \phi : \varphi^{-1}(U) \longrightarrow U\) is equal to \(\varphi\).]]></answer>

        <answer><![CDATA[For the smooth fiber bundle \((E, B, \varphi, F),\) suppose that for \(k \geq 0\):<br /><br/>
            1. The abstract fiber \(F\) and \(\varphi^{-1}(b)\) is equipped with a vector space structure for each \(b \in B\).<br />
            2. The diffeomorphism \(\varphi^{-1}(U) \longrightarrow U \times F\) restricts to the linear map \(\varphi^{-1}(b) \longrightarrow \{b\} \times F\) of
            vector spaces for each \(b \in B\).]]></answer>
