        <answer><![CDATA[
            By the Third Sylow Theorem, the number of Sylow \( 7 \)-subgroups of \( G \) must divide \( 35 \) and be congruent to \( 1 \) modulo \( 7 \). Since \( 35 = 5 \times 7 \), the number of Sylow \( 7 \)-subgroups can only be \( 1 \) or \( 5 \).
            However, if there were \( 5 \) Sylow \( 7 \)-subgroups, each containing \( 7 - 1 = 6 \) elements of order \( 7 \), this would account for \( 30 \) elements, leaving only \( 35 - 30 = 5 \) elements to form a Sylow \( 5 \)-subgroup, which is impossible since the order of a Sylow \( 5 \)-subgroup must divide \( 35 \) and be congruent to \( 1 \) modulo \( 5 \). Hence, there must be a unique Sylow \( 7 \)-subgroup in \( G \), which is therefore normal.

        <question><![CDATA[Prove that a group of order \( 56 \) has a normal Sylow \( 7 \)-subgroup.]]></question>
        <answer><![CDATA[
            By the Third Sylow Theorem, the number of Sylow \( 7 \)-subgroups of \( G \) must divide \( 56 \) and be congruent to \( 1 \) modulo \( 7 \). Since \( 56 = 2^3 \times 7 \), the possible number of Sylow \( 7 \)-subgroups can be \( 1 \), \( 8 \), or \( 56 \). However, if there were \( 8 \) Sylow \( 7 \)-subgroups, each containing \( 7 - 1 = 6 \) elements of order \( 7 \), this would account for \( 48 \) elements, leaving only \( 56 - 48 = 8 \) elements to form a Sylow \( 2 \)-subgroup, which is impossible since the order of a Sylow \( 2 \)-subgroup must divide \( 56 \) and be congruent to \( 1 \) modulo \( 2 \). Similarly, if there were \( 56 \) Sylow \( 7 \)-subgroups, this would account for \( 56 \times 6 = 336 \) elements of order \( 7 \), leaving only \( 56 \) elements to form a Sylow \( 2 \)-subgroup, which is again impossible. Hence, there must be a unique Sylow \( 7 \)-subgroup in \( G \), which is therefore normal.

        <question><![CDATA[Let \( G \) be a group of order \( 60 \). Prove that \( G \) is not simple.]]></question>
        <answer><![CDATA[
        Assume for contradiction that \( G \) is simple. By the Third Sylow Theorem, the number of Sylow \( 5 \)-subgroups of \( G \) must divide \( 60 \) and be congruent to \( 1 \) modulo \( 5 \). The only possibilities are \( 1 \) or \( 6 \). If there is only \( 1 \) Sylow \( 5 \)-subgroup, then it is normal in \( G \), so assume there are \( 6 \) Sylow \( 5 \)-subgroups. Each Sylow \( 5 \)-subgroup contains \( 5 - 1 = 4 \) elements of order \( 5 \), which accounts for \( 4 \times 6 = 24 \) elements. Since there are \( 60 \) elements in total, there must be \( 60 - 24 = 36 \) elements of order \( 2 \) or \( 3 \). However, if there are \( 36 \) elements of order \( 2 \) or \( 3 \), they can form at most \( 36/2 = 18 \) conjugacy classes. Since \( G \) is simple, there must be \( 60 \) conjugacy classes, which is a contradiction. Therefore, \( G \) cannot be simple.
